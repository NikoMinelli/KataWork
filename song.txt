Sat in the bando watching Snap weren't good for my mental health
The things that I see on a daily basis be on the Daily Mail (for real)
Why the hell would I dwell on the past when I make profit off the pain I felt? (Pain)
How the fuck these guys gonna date these girls
When they can't even pay for themselves? (How?)

Few of these females left me on read back then but look now I bet they regret it
They used to ask what I do for a living, I said that I work in the chemist (trap)
I had no money, I weren't embarrassed, I'm doing up road in my Toyota Yaris (trap)
See squalay tryna cut through traffic
Rule number one don't panic (rule number one)

I know they hate that they can't ignore me, I'm all over London town
It's funny to think that I went OT when I was 16 for a hundred pound
I get gyal easy you know
True, LYM we don't run them down
I couldn't care less what they say on the blogs
As long as my mumsy proud (exactly that)

I keep on tellin' the young bulls, "Grind, don't quit", cah it's all about timin'
Bro's on a ped with a brick on him
And he's tryna blend in so he's wearing a hi-vis
Always tryna get the party turnt, that's how I got nicked at wireless
I told lil' bro when I stepped out of cells, it's calm, one day I'll headline it

They done man wrong, where are they now?
Nowhere to be seen (where they at?)
The powers strong, where am I now?
I been in the charts for 18 weeks
My bro stay knocking man out, make man tap out
But he stay on his deen like Khabib
Bro, I know it's long time no see
But I'm here whenever you need
