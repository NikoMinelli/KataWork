Sat in the bando watching Snap weren't good for my mental health
The things that I see on a daily basis be on the Daily Mail (for real)
Why the hell would I dwell on the past when I make profit off the pain I felt? (Pain)
How the fuck these guys gonna date these girls
When they can't even pay for themselves? (How?)

Few of these females left me on read back then but look now I bet they regret it
They used to ask what I do for a living, I said that I work in the chemist (trap)
I had no money, I weren't embarrassed, I'm doing up road in my Toyota Yaris (trap)
See squalay tryna cut through traffic
Rule number one don't panic (rule number one)

I know they hate that they can't ignore me, I'm all over London town
It's funny to think that I went OT when I was 16 for a hundred pound
I get gyal easy you know
True, LYM we don't run them down
I couldn't care less what they say on the blogs
As long as my mumsy proud (exactly that)

I keep on tellin' the young bulls, "Grind, don't quit", cah it's all about timin'
Bro's on a ped with a brick on him
And he's tryna blend in so he's wearing a hi-vis
Always tryna get the party turnt, that's how I got nicked at wireless
I told lil' bro when I stepped out of cells, it's calm, one day I'll headline it

They done man wrong, where are they now?
Nowhere to be seen (where they at?)
The powers strong, where am I now?
I been in the charts for 18 weeks
My bro stay knocking man out, make man tap out
But he stay on his deen like Khabib
Bro, I know it's long time no see
But I'm here whenever you need
Put my life on the line to see bro elevate
Sometimes I feel like I'm way too generous
Step on the gas one time accelerate (uh-huh)
I need the same time piece as Federer's
First flight that I took was a EasyJet, now it's DXB, I'm on Emirates
Live Your Movie, I say it with emphasis, but the flow too effortless

I'm wary, gotta stay on my pivot (stay on it)
Remindin' myself it's business
Gotta stay out my feelings
Still gotta weigh up my options (options)
I've met a lot of these rappers (and)
And we ain't got nuttin in common (alright)
Tryna ship out the bud from Cali
Everyone got bud from Holland (from Holland)

The week that I dropped my tape Wild West
I painted my city orange
I see a lot of videos look like mine
I don't even mind, just pay me homage
Stuck in the trenches, skin go pale
I been in L.A., now my skin look olive
I told lil' bro, gotta stay in school
I'm a bad example I didn't go college

I listen a lot but I don't speak much
I kept it brief, she think that I'm shy
She down for the cause, I told her I'm done
She said she want more, I brang in my guy
I was dead broke, I had no hope
I sat and I thought 'bout ending my life
I was down bad and they asked how I am
I got up like a man and I said, "I'm alright"

I got on my grind didn't make excuses
Stayed in the trap got hot got humid
The hood just full up of drug consumers
So we abuse it
If I don't do it, then someone gon' do it
Trusted a man and he done me like Judas
Bare opportunist, no opportunity
Trust in the government, but they all clueless

They done man wrong, where are they now?
Nowhere to be seen (where they at?)
The powers strong, where am I now?
I been in the charts for 18 weeks
My bro stay knocking man out, make man tap out
But he stay on his deen like Khabib
Bro, I know it's long time no see
But I'm here whenever you need
